The **Question Paper Generator** has been developed to override the problems
prevailing in the practicing manual system.This software supported to reduce the
hardships faced by the existing system.In this system we present a smart
question paper generating system for universities.This application is reduced as
much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data.

It is made to allow professors to generate question papers with random but
enough questions to cover most chapters of a subject with difficulty level
(1-10) and mail them to examiner instantly. The purpose of this system is to
automate the existing manual system by the help of computerized equipment
,fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be
stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same.
