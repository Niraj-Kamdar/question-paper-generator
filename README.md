There are many schools and colleges that take frequent exams and creating a
perfect balanced paper for all these exams are a difficult task. Most of the
teachers already have a long question bank for the courses he is teaching. So,
we are providing a system where s/he can generate a random paper with
constraints specified by him/her. We currently support four such constraints:

1. Difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
2. Cognitive level (Application, Knowledge, Comprehension)
3. Unit wise mark distribution
4. Question Type (Subjective, Objective)

The system also stores all previously generated papers so that teachers can
access it anytime. The system is designed to not repeat previously asked
questions. The system also provides an option to email generated paper in PDF
format to the examiner.

The purpose of this system is to automate the existing manual system by the help
of computerized equipment, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable
data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and
manipulation of the same.
