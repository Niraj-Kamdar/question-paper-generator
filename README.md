## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites

You will need `python 3.6+` installed.

### Installing

After cloning/downloading this repository enable virtual environment for current project and install necessary packages from requirements.txt with following command

```console
python -m venv venv
cd venv
cd scripts
./activate
cd ../..
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running

Before running following commands make sure you are in virtual environment. You can verify it by checking `(venv)` in the start. If your virtual environment isn't activated then activate it using following command
```console
cd venv
cd scripts
./activate
cd ../..
```
If your environment is activated then run following command to start webserver.
```console
python run.py
```

### Migrating

When you change database schema i.e change model or add new models you have to perform following commands before running server. Ofcourse you have to activate venv as we have discussed above.

If your environment is activated then run following command to upgrade database.
```console
python manage.py db migrate -m "Migration message"
python manage.py db upgrade
```
